### **About Us**

#### Experience Areas

I'm continously acquiring knowledgement, studiying and practicing with efforts to grow as a professional developer. For the moment i have experience in the next areas:

##### **Web Developing**

- **Front end**
     - _Coding HTML_ 
     - _CSS stylesheets_
     - _javascript_ 
       > (in this language i'm not an expert, but soon i will be. 🤣😄)
      
- **Back end**	
     - _Databases_
       > (same as above. I have knowledge in Microsoft SQL server, No-SQL, Postgre)
     - Data Analysis

the principal idea and goal to come, is that i become a fullstack web developer and an IT professional; i'm studiying a career, well really i'm studiying two careers: **Web develop** and **Cloud computing**. In a few months, if all goes fine, i'm going to have some certifies that demonstrate my preparation and support it.

Among other areas that belong to the branch of this career, you know right.

In this area I dare say that I have more experience and knowledge,
~~but i'm not yet totally an expert jeje~~ 😅😛

Yes, it's me [nyarlatotep](https://github.com/nyarlatotep) being this, **CresalexCompany** is a project, small at the moment and, so far personal and individual but with intentions and sights to grow within the industry and beautiful world of computing and code development; providing quality and possibly customizable services and solutions to the company or person who needs and requires it.

So, if you wanted to join the team, you would be well received and your knowledge and experience would be very helpful and would be appreciated and of course the financial issue would be discussed and established before deciding on any situation. In the same way, but on the other hand, if you wanted to ask about any service or doubt it would be clarified or provided with pleasure 🙂😉🤝
